            This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was
            travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand
            head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its
            speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of
            animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil
            gait, uttering now and then deafening

          bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a
          particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it
          is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.

          The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but
          Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry,
          remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
          please the buffaloes to get out of the way. Passepartout was furious
          at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
          revolvers upon them.

          "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in
          a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I
          should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!
          And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into
          this herd of beasts!"

          <span>&#8221;</span> The engineer did not try to overcome the
          obstacle, and he was wise.
